# Todo App 
My very first project using React (including hooks and context). 
It's simple todo app with a few features:
* add a new task
* edit a task
* delete a task
* mark a task as done
* data saved through local storage

## Getting started
Clone down this repo. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser and create your task list! :white_check_mark:
